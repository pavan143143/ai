    # AI Approach

Recommended hybrid approach:
- Rules: Safety & legal constraints (no overlapping bookings, min transfer times).
- Optimization: OR-Tools or heuristics + Pareto front computation for multi-objective tradeoffs.
- Preference learning: embeddings + online bandit-style adaptation.
- LLM: Natural language UX, summarization & clarifying questions; ensure outputs are grounded.
